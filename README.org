* OCIM-BGC-48layer model

*** Code_48layer: src, driver, and make_datafile
- src: Source code for BGC modeling
- driver: Main driver for BGC modeling
- make_datafile: Make the datafile for 48layer model (i.e., pme, NPP from satelite data...)

*** DATA: Supporting data used to run the inverse model. 
Some large data files (e.g., climatological mean NPP data and Transport operator of 48layer) are not uploaded to github. Please refer the DFS-L in greenplanet. We will also move all the rawdata and supporting data files in other drive.

* To do list
*** (1) Sensitivity test for the vertical structure of NPP.
*** (2) Tune the piston velocity and reoptimize the BGC model parameters to find DIC in preindustrial period.
*** (3) Clean up the code and merge to 24layer model.
